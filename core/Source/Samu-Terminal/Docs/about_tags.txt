// About tags.

Alright, remember the tags in Doom Builder?

Well the components works in a similar way!

A tag is a group identifier who can help you to make a lot of changes
in a group of components.

The tags here is mostly used to make pages, categories, whatever you call it.
To move between tags, you use the STEXE_GTCAT command on the click of a button
in the terminal.

When you apply STEXE_GTCAT, it will show a set of components who holds the tag
that you want to see with the argument one of the STExecute.

The only one who can ignore this command, is the one who is set as an "alpha tag"

The alphatag is the tag that can be shown, no matter what page, or category you
want to see.
