Fixed a glitch which let's you create turrets, but without checking the credits.
Now the commander should check the terrain, if the spawning of a turret or dispenser is being blocked, or placed in liquids (wip) the spawning will fail, but the team credits will be refunded.
Hidden some spamming on the server log console.
The turrets shall now delete themselves with the base included.
Now the kill-streak flow will not be interrupted by the building of a deployable item.
Spawnshield should work again (needs some testing though)
Pressing F12 (Coop Spy) will force you to look at the commander screen.
Small fix on the sf_doorholdtime cvar.
Removed the useless rune sync from the player upgrades. But this is'nt the last time you see it.
Other smoll fixes.
